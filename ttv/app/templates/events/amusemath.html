           Three centuries earlier, Galileo had written, "Nature's great book is written in mathematical language"  Mathematics is the language of nature. It is music  to mind. Without  mathematics we canâ€™t imagine the world. It is a play that starts with 0 and ends with infinity.  Here is an  opportunity to play with mathematics and test your mathematical skills.
