                Quadcopter kit will be provided only during the duration of the workshop for training purpose.It won't be given to the students permanently.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if the students wish to get the kit permanently , they may do so by purchasing it at reduced prizes.For that extra charges other than the registration fees have to be paid.
            </p>
